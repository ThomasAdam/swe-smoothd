 * Written by Martin Houston <martin.houston@smoothwall.net>
 * This program is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public
 * Licence.  See the file COPYING for details.
 *
 * filename: ipbatch.h
 * Direct interface into iptables. 
 * If you need to do iptables commands in youtr plugin include this
 * header file and you have a choice of two APIs.
 * The preferred method is with a vector but there is also
 * a function callable from C code that takes just a char *
 * What is provided is a valid iptables command line
 * e.g. "iptables -nvL"
 * All iptables commands must be valid and must succeed - i.e. you must not 
 * attempt to remove a table that is not there. As commands are 
 * being submitted as a batch any failure will leave iptables
 * in an undefined state.
